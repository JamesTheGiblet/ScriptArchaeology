# ScriptArchaeology: Reverse Engineering Writing Systems

## Overview
ScriptArchaeology takes modern, abstract writing systems and reverse-engineers them to reveal their possible pictographic origins. Unlike ScriptForge which evolves forward from pictures to abstractions, ScriptArchaeology goes backwards - taking simplified, phonetic scripts and "de-evolving" them into complex pictographs, or takes ancient pictographic systems like Egyptian hieroglyphics and lets you evolve them forward into modern scripts.

## Core Concept
Every modern alphabet came from somewhere. Latin came from Greek, Greek from Phoenician, Phoenician from Egyptian hieroglyphics. Each step simplified, abstracted, and phonetically encoded. ScriptArchaeology reverses this process, showing what the Latin alphabet might have looked like if we traced it back to pictographic roots, or what hieroglyphics might become if evolved further.

## Modes

### 1. Reverse Evolution Mode
- Start with modern alphabet (A, B, C, D...)
- Run backwards in time
- Add complexity and detail
- Restore pictographic elements
- Show possible ancient origins

### 2. Forward Evolution Mode
- Start with hieroglyphics or complex pictographs
- Evolve toward abstraction
- Watch simplification happen
- See phonetic encoding emerge
- End at alphabet-like symbols

### 3. Comparative Mode
- Load two scripts (e.g., Latin and Arabic)
- Find common ancestor
- Show divergence points
- Track shared etymology

### 4. Historical Reconstruction
- Load known historical scripts
- Egyptian Hieroglyphics → Hieratic → Demotic
- Phoenician → Greek → Latin
- Oracle Bone Script → Modern Chinese
- Cuneiform evolution

## Evolution Mechanics

### Adding Pictographic Detail (Reverse)
- Increase stroke count
- Add representational elements
- Restore semantic meaning to shapes
- Branch into specialized variants
- Make symbols less ambiguous

### Simplification (Forward)
- Reduce stroke count
- Abstract away detail
- Merge similar symbols
- Develop phonetic usage
- Standardize forms

### Phonetic Encoding
- Rebus principle application
- Sound-based symbol usage
- Syllabary formation
- Alphabetic convergence

## Real Historical Examples

### Latin "A"
- Modern: Δ (triangle)
- Greek Alpha: Α
- Phoenician Aleph: 𐤀
- Egyptian: 𓃾 (ox/bull head)
- **Reverse engineer this chain!**

### Chinese Characters
- Modern: 木 (tree)
- Bronze Age: More detailed tree drawing
- Oracle Bone: Pictographic tree
- **Show the actual progression!**

### Egyptian Evolution
- Hieroglyphics: Detailed pictures
- Hieratic: Cursive simplification
- Demotic: Further abstraction
- Coptic (with Greek): Nearly alphabetic
